## Playing the game
The aim of MineSweeper is to reveal all of the tiles NOT containing a Mine, each tile can contain one but you have to figure out which tiles do, you can use the numbers on the grid, these numbers represent the number of mines in the 8 tiles surrounding it, so incase of a '1' there is a single mine in the 8 surrounding grids, you can use several of these numbered tiles to figure out which tiles contain a mine. Succeed and you win!, reveal a mine and you lose

#### Controls
"Arrow keys" to move the curser (UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT),
"Spacebar" to reveal a tile
"F" to flag a tile.

#### Flags
Flags can be used to keep track of where the mines are, and to mark them, so you cannot accidentally reveal them
a flag can be placed by pressing 'F' and be removed by moving the cursor ontop and pressing 'F" again.

#### Revealing
A tile starts out as hidden ("#") you can reveal a tile my pressing "Spacebar", if you reveal a tile containing a mine you lose. A tile cannot be hidden again.
